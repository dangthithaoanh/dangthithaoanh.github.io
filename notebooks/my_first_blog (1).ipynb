        " NLP systems such as large language models (e.g., GPT-3.5, Claude) can do a wide range of language tasks, from assigning labels to text to writing an essay. In order to do that, the systems must have an efficient way to process language. The computers can only understand numbers. Therefore, it is crucial to convert text into numbers and ensure that those numbers reflect the important properties of the text it represents. The subsections below, I will explain the steps to achieve this. Traditional and mordern techniques are presented. I will also discuss the strength and weakness of each approach.\n"

In Cell 3, the Hebrew word 'אגס', meaning 'pear', require six bytes to represent although it only has three characters. Moreover, some Hebrew words have diacritics and ligatures, which require some more bytes to encode. Using more bytes make the encoding process more computationally expensive and cause problem for other tasks such as slicing, indexing, and tokenizing because the additional bytes may blur the boundaries between the characters. In addition, unlike other languages, Hebrew character, words, and sentences are read from left to right. This characteristic challenge the encoding task. From the code cell, it can be seen that Hebrew characters are also encoded from left to right. However, in some cases, Hebrew words may be accompanied by Roman numerals, then they must be read from left to right. Such inconsistencies may cause confusion to the encoding task."

BPE works by merging the most frequent sequences of characters into a larger sub-word within a word and building a vocabulary consisting of meaningful sub-words. The starting point is the character strings that have been separated by the white space character, so-called words. Each character is considered as a token. The algorithm will first select the most frequent adjacent characters in the training corpus and treat them as a single token. Then this 2-character token is frequntly occur with another character and they are merged into another single token. The same procedure applies to the rest of the characters.\n",

This way, it can learn the prefixes and suffixes of words. It can effectively recognize that -ment and -ous, for example, are common sub-word. This method work well for aggutinative languages such as English and German, which use affixes to express grammatical and semantic relations. BPE does not work exactly the same way for isolated languages such as Chinese and Vietnamese because they do not have subwords. It will likely to treat sequences of characters separated by white space as a single token.\n",

        "Apart from words, there are larger units of text. The most basic one is sentences. Many sentences are separated by a period \".\" but some types of sentences may end in other special characters, such as \"!\" and \"?\". In NLP, it is important to help the computer understand that each sentence carry a certain meaning. The task of segmenting text into sentences is called parsing. Intuitively, it is possible to split text by \".\", \"!\", and \"?\". However, sometimes this basic approach is problematic because these characters do not always mark the end of a sentence. For examole, decimal numbers contain periods (e.g., 0.5). A more linguistically-driven approach is to segment sentences based on the relationship between words, called dependency parsing or constituency parsing. The algorithm first assigns a part-of-speech to each token in the sentence. This task is called part-of-speech tagging. It aims to identify the syntactic relationship between words. The code below shows how this can be done using spacy."

Therefore, cases should be remained in such tasks. Uppercase words may be the abbreviation of longer phrases so doing case folding may alter the meaning of such words. For example, TELL is the short form of Technology-Enhanced Language Learning. If it is reduced to lowercase, it becomes a totally different word. Another situation that case folding should not be done is when the language itself is case-sensitive. For instance, German nouns are always captitalized, so cases signal the part of speech of the word. Avoiding standardizing cases would help the NLP system learn the language and produce it with the correct capitalization norm."

        "To calculate $P(w_n|w_{n-1},w_{n-2},w_{n-3})$, the model has to divide the count of the sequence ($w_n, w_{n-1},w_{n-2},w_{n-3}$) by the count of the previous sequence ($w_{n-1},w_{n-2},w_{n-3}$). For example, to know the probability of the word \"by\" given the context \"He is bitten\". The model search in the training corpus for every instance \"He is bitten by\" and divide its count to the count of \"He is bitten\". This approach is called ***Maximum Likelihood Estimation.*** The exact formula is showb below. It is taken from Jurafsky and Martin (2023)."

        "While n-gram model is computationally efficient and has been widely used, it has a few limitations. Firstly, dues to the fixed context size, the model is unable to process long-range dependencies. In some certain cases, a larger context is needed to predict the next word. Secondly, it cannot deal with unseen words. If an n-gram model encounters a word that is not in the training data, it is usually replaced with an unknown token. The model will then ignore this token and extend the context to the next word. However    "
